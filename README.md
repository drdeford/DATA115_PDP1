# Legislative Voting Data

## Motivation
I originally started thinking about this data while working on this paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02530"> A Random Dot Product Model for Weighted Networks</a> joint with Dan Rockmore, where we detected the party structure in the US Senate using an inference technique associated to dot product networks. A natural follow up question is attempting to apply this method to legislatures that have more than two parties. This led me to compare voting data from both houses of the US Congress to voting data from the European Parliament. 

## Data Sources
I obtained the US voting data from the <a href="https://voteview.com/data">Voteview</a> site[1] 

## Processing Steps

## Visualizations

## Analysis

## Descriptions of Code and Materials
The raw data downloaded from the sources described above is contained in the `Raw_Data` folder, while the .csv files generated as a result of the processing procedures are contained in `Processed_Data`. There is one Jupyter notebook for each legislative body that does the processing and generates the relevant figures.
